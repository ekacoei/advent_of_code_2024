# What

Advent of Code is a programming puzzle. I takes place each year in December. These are my solutions in Ruby.

# But why

I need to learn Ruby and this is a fun way

# Can I use your code?

You can use it as a bad example. The Code is Gnu Affero Public License.
You can also look at my required time to solve the puzzles, so you do not need to feel bad about your timing.

Each day, you are given a cover story, a ridicoulus task to parse some text input and return a single string as puzzle solution. The puzzle input is kind of unique[1] to your login. The cover story provides your requirements and an example input and output. The requirements are very detailed so you can focus on the programming task - except there are some gotchas, like undocumented multi line input, expected state in your parser before the first keyword...
... requirements are mostly documented.

[1] there are $fixnum buckets of input, we do not know how many there are, but we have seen Input getting fixed
